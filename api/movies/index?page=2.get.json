        "description": "Ellie (Queen Latifah) and Manny (Ray Romano) are expecting their first child, and Manny is nervously obsessed with making life perfect and safe for Ellie, until the baby's born, since his first experiences as a husband and father went bad when his family was killed by hunters. At the same time, Diego (Denis Leary) finds himself unable to catch a cocky gazelle (Bill Hader) he has been stalking and decides to leave the herd, believing that he is losing his predatory nature as a tiger. Sid (John Leguizamo) grows jealous of Manny and Ellie and 'adopts' three apparently abandoned eggs that he finds in an icy underground cavern and call them Eggbert, Shelly, and Yoko. Manny tells him to put them back (saying Sid would never make a good parent, saying, 'First sign: Stealing someone else's eggs. Second sign: One of them almost became an omelette.'), but Sid instead looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby Tyrannosaurus triplets the next morning.",

        "description": "Dominick Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and business partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) perform corporate espionage using an experimental military technology to infiltrate the subconscious of their targets and extract information while dreaming. Their latest target is Japanese businessman Saito (Ken Watanabe). Tiered 'dream within a dream' strategies are used and dreamers awaken by a 'kick' such as dying in the dream or falling. If the dreamer is the one who awakens, the dream 'collapses'. Each 'extractor' carries a totem, a small object whose behavior only its owner can predict, used to determine whether a dreamer is in someone else's dream. Cobb's totem is implied to be a spinning top that spins perpetually in the dream state. The extraction fails when sabotaged by a memory of Cobb's deceased wife Mal (Marion Cotillard). Saito reveals, after Cobb's and Arthur's associate sells them out, that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of 'inception': planting an idea in a person's subconscious while they sleep.
